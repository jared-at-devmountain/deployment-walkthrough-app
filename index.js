//every file in that folder
//so once we do this express.static()
//there will be a GET endpoint, '/index.html' that serves the HTML file as a response,
//a GET enpoint, '/main.js' that serves the JS file as a response,
//a GET enpoint, '/styles.css', that serves the CSS file as a response
//a GET endpoint, '/', that serves index.html's HTML specifically
